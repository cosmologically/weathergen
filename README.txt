Weather generator written for @ark_forecast on twitter, part of the Aldebaran Sea roleplay group.

In order to run the program, you will need the following to be installed and functional:
  - Python 2.7
  - pip
  - tweepy (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
  - a twitter developer account, so that the program may post tweets for you using your dev keys
  
  Download all included files. 
  Open weathergen.py in a text editor and update lines 20 and 25 with the full path to the .txt files.
  Update lines 36-39 with your twitter dev keys.
  To temporarily disable posting to twitter (such as in the case of troubleshooting using the command line), simply comment out line 56.
