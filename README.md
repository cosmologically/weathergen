## weathergen.py
Generates weather descriptions for fictional environments and tweets them. Can be repurposed for any other randomizer which uses lists to generate results, and then tweet them.

### Requirements
  - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
  - [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) 
  - [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
  - a twitter developer account, so that the program may post tweets for you using your dev keys

### Basic setup
Download all included files. 

Open weathergen.py in a text editor and update lines 20 and 25 with the full path to the .txt files.

Update lines 36-39 with your twitter dev keys.

(To temporarily disable posting to twitter (such as in the case of troubleshooting using the command line), simply comment out line 56.)
